**Assigned To:** bmad-developer  
**Assigned By:** bmad-scrum-master  

## Assignment Summary

You have been assigned Story 2.2: Testing Infrastructure. This story has passed all BMAD METHOD quality checks and is ready for implementation.

**Story Location:** `/workspace/docs/stories/2.2.testing-infrastructure.md`  
**Quality Assessment:** `/workspace/reports/story-assessment-2.2-2025-07-29.md`  

## Story Overview

### Objective
Set up a comprehensive testing infrastructure for the Ollama-OpenAI Proxy project, enabling developers to write and run unit and integration tests with proper coverage reporting.

### Key Deliverables
1. Pytest configuration with async support and coverage reporting
2. Test directory structure following project standards
3. Shared test fixtures in conftest.py
4. Working Makefile targets for test execution
5. Example tests demonstrating the infrastructure works
6. Coverage reporting with 80% minimum threshold

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Path Items
1. **pytest.ini configuration** - This is the foundation for all testing
2. **Test directory structure** - Must be created before any tests
3. **conftest.py with fixtures** - Required for test consistency
4. **Makefile targets** - Enables test execution

### Technical Requirements
- pytest 7.4.4
- pytest-asyncio 0.23.3  
- pytest-cov 4.1.0
- All dependencies already in requirements-dev.txt from Epic 1

## Special Instructions

1. **Configuration First**: Ensure pytest.ini is properly configured before creating any tests
2. **Meta-Testing**: Create tests that verify the testing infrastructure itself works
3. **Async Support**: Use `asyncio_mode = auto` in pytest.ini for seamless async testing
4. **Coverage Enforcement**: Configure coverage to fail builds if below 80%
5. **Marker Usage**: Implement `unit` and `integration` markers for test separation

## Definition of Done

Before marking this story complete, ensure:
1. All 8 acceptance criteria are met
2. All subtasks are completed
3. Tests can be run via Makefile targets
4. Coverage reporting works and shows results
5. Example tests pass successfully
6. Story documentation is updated with completion notes

## Next Steps

1. Read the full story at `/workspace/docs/stories/2.2.testing-infrastructure.md`
2. Review existing project structure to understand context
3. Implement the testing infrastructure following the detailed specifications
4. Run all tests to verify everything works
5. Update the story file with your completion notes
6. Submit for QA review

## Support

If you encounter any blockers or need clarification:
1. Document the issue in the story file
2. Request assistance with specific technical details
3. Reference the architecture documentation if needed
