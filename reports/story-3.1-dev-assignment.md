# Story 3.1 Development Assignment

**Assignment Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Assigned To:** James (Dev Agent)  
**Assigned By:** Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Story:** 3.1 - Model Listing Endpoint Implementation  
**Epic:** Epic 3 - Model Listing Endpoint (/api/tags)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Target Completion:** End of day 2025-07-31  

## Assignment Context

Epic 2 (Core Infrastructure) has been completed successfully. All foundational components are in place:
- FastAPI application structure
- Logging and error handling utilities  
- Testing infrastructure
- Code quality tooling

You are now implementing the first API endpoint that will prove our translation pattern works end-to-end.

## Story Overview

**Story File:** `/workspace/docs/stories/3.1.model-listing-endpoint.md`

**Purpose:** Implement the GET /api/tags endpoint that fetches available models from OpenAI and returns them in Ollama format.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Create the endpoint handler
2. Fetch models from OpenAI API
3. Translate the response to Ollama format
4. Handle errors appropriately
5. Write comprehensive tests

## Technical Context

### Existing Infrastructure You'll Use:
- FastAPI app in `app/main.py`
- Logging utilities in `app/utils/logging.py`
- Error handling in `app/utils/errors.py`
- Test fixtures in `references/openai-examples/models.json`

### Key Files You'll Create:
- `app/handlers/tags.py` - Endpoint handler
- `app/translators/response.py` - Translation logic (if not exists)
- `tests/unit/test_tags_handler.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/test_tags_integration.py` - Integration tests

## Development Workflow

1. **Review the Story**: Read `/workspace/docs/stories/3.1.model-listing-endpoint.md` thoroughly
2. **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, especially the integration test with Ollama SDK
3. **Implementation**: Follow the task breakdown in the story
4. **Testing**: Ensure 80% coverage minimum
5. **Code Quality**: Run `make quality` before marking complete
6. **Documentation**: Update the story with completion notes and file list

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Endpoint returns 200 status with proper Ollama format
- [ ] OpenAI errors are translated correctly
- [ ] All tests pass (unit and integration)
- [ ] Code quality checks pass (black, flake8, mypy)
- [ ] Ollama SDK can successfully parse the response
- [ ] Story status updated to "Done" with dev notes

## Important Notes

1. **Model Format**: Pay close attention to the format differences between OpenAI and Ollama
2. **Mock Data**: Use the examples in `references/openai-examples/models.json` for testing
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure all OpenAI SDK exceptions are caught and translated
4. **Logging**: Use structured logging for all operations
5. **Async**: Remember all I/O operations should use async/await

## Environment Setup

Ensure you have:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"  # Required for integration tests
```

## Completion Checklist

Before marking the story as done:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All tasks/subtasks completed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Story document updated with:
  - Dev Agent Model Used
  - Completion Notes
  - File List
  - Any debug log references
- [ ] Ready for QA review

## Support

If you encounter blockers:
1. Check the architecture documents in `/workspace/docs/architecture/`
2. Review Epic 2 implementation for patterns
3. The story has comprehensive dev notes with all needed context

Good luck with the implementation! This is the first endpoint that proves our architecture works, so attention to detail is important.

**Note:** Story 3.2 (Model Translation Enhancement) will be assigned after 3.1 is complete, as it builds on the translation foundation you establish.
