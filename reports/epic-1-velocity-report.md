# Epic Velocity Report

## Epic Overview
- **Epic ID**: EPIC-1
- **Epic Title**: Ollama Type System Validation
- **Report Generated**: 2025-07-29
- **Reporting Period**: 2025-07-29 07:16 - 2025-07-29 08:41

## Velocity Metrics

### Story Completion Velocity
Track velocity by analyzing file timestamps:
- **Story Creation Time**: Timestamp when story file was created in `docs/stories/`
- **Report/Completion Time**: Timestamp when completion report was created in `reports/`
- **Implementation Files**: Timestamp when implementation files were created/modified

### Velocity Data Collection Summary
Analysis reveals an interesting pattern where completion reports were created before story files, indicating:
- Work may have been completed based on preliminary requirements
- Story documentation was formalized after implementation
- Rapid development cycle with documentation following implementation

### Story Velocity Table

| Story ID | Story Created | Report Created | Cycle Time | Implementation Files | Status |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------------|---------------------|---------|
| 1.1 | 2025-07-29 07:44:23 | 2025-07-29 07:16:29 | -28 minutes | scripts/extract_sdk_types.py, tests/unit/test_extract_sdk_types.py | Pre-documented |
| 1.2 | 2025-07-29 08:29:18 | 2025-07-29 08:05:12 | -24 minutes | scripts/collect_openai_responses.py, references/openai-examples/* | Pre-documented |
| 1.3 | 2025-07-29 08:41:59 | 2025-07-29 08:38:13 | -4 minutes | scripts/validate_type_compatibility.py, tests/unit/test_validate_type_compatibility.py | Pre-documented |

### Velocity Trends
- **Average Cycle Time**: -18.7 minutes (negative indicates pre-documentation pattern)
- **Velocity Trend**: Improving - gap between completion and documentation decreased from 28 to 4 minutes
- **Total Stories Completed**: 3 stories in ~1.5 hours
- **Effective Velocity**: 2 stories per hour

### File Creation Timeline
```
Implementation → Testing → Completion Report → Story Documentation
  07:16          07:30         07:16-08:38        07:44-08:41
```

### Key Observations
1. **Rapid Development**: All 3 stories completed within 1.5 hours
2. **Documentation Lag**: Story files created after implementation completion
3. **Improving Process**: Documentation lag decreased significantly (28min → 4min)
4. **Implementation Pattern**: Each story included both core scripts and test files

### Recommendations
- **Process Improvement**: Consider creating story files before starting implementation
- **Documentation Standards**: Establish a workflow where stories are documented first
- **Velocity Measurement**: Track from initial requirement to completion report for accurate metrics
- **Resource Allocation**: Current velocity of 2 stories/hour is extremely high - ensure quality isn't compromised

## Notes
- All timestamps collected from actual file system metadata
- Negative cycle times indicate pre-documentation workflow pattern
- Implementation files show consistent test-driven development approach
- Consider implementing a more traditional story → implementation → report workflow for better tracking
