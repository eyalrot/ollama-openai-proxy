# Epic 3 Assignment - Model Listing Endpoint (/api/tags)

**Assignment Date:** 2025-07-31  
**Assigned To:** Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Assigned By:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Epic:** Epic 3 - Model Listing Endpoint (/api/tags)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Target Duration:** 2 days  

## Assignment Context

Epic 2 (Core Infrastructure & Testing Framework) has been completed with all 4 stories implemented and approved. The project is ready to begin implementing the API endpoints, starting with the simplest endpoint to validate our translation pattern.

## Epic 3 Overview

**Purpose:** Implement the /api/tags endpoint to list available OpenAI models in Ollama format, proving the translation pattern works end-to-end.

**Dependencies:** 
- ✅ Epic 1: SDK Type Extraction & Response Collection (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Epic 2: Core Infrastructure & Testing Framework (COMPLETE)

**Deliverables:**
- Working `/api/tags` endpoint
- Model translation logic (OpenAI → Ollama format)
- Integration tests with Ollama SDK

## Requirements from PRD

### Functional Requirements
- FR2: The `/api/tags` endpoint MUST return available OpenAI models formatted as Ollama model list with dummy metadata for missing fields
- FR8: Error responses from OpenAI MUST be translated to Ollama-compatible error formats
- FR11: The proxy MUST pass all Ollama SDK integration tests for supported endpoints

### Technical Context
- Endpoint: GET /api/tags
- Returns list of available models from OpenAI
- Must translate OpenAI model format to Ollama's expected format
- Should handle errors gracefully with proper error translation
- Must include integration tests using actual Ollama SDK

## Story Creation Guidelines

### Suggested Story Breakdown
Consider breaking this epic into 2-3 focused stories:

1. **Endpoint Implementation & Basic Translation**
   - Create the /api/tags route
   - Implement basic model fetching from OpenAI
   - Create initial translation logic

2. **Model Translation & Metadata Enhancement**
   - Complete OpenAI to Ollama format translation
   - Add dummy metadata for missing fields
   - Handle edge cases and model variations

3. **Integration Testing & Error Handling** (if needed as separate story)
   - Comprehensive integration tests with Ollama SDK
   - Error scenario testing
   - Performance validation

### Key Considerations

1. **TDD Approach**: Tests should be written first using the Ollama SDK
2. **Use Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage the translation framework from Epic 2
3. **Reference Data**: Use collected OpenAI responses from `references/openai-examples/`
4. **Type Safety**: Utilize Pydantic models from `references/ollama-types/`

### Technical Notes

From the architecture document:
- The Response Translator component should handle model list translation
- Use the OpenAI Client Wrapper for fetching models
- Follow the established error handling patterns
- Ensure structured logging for all operations

## Definition of Ready Checklist

Before stories are ready for development, ensure:
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria following GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format
- [ ] Technical implementation notes included
- [ ] Test scenarios defined
- [ ] Dependencies on Epic 2 components identified
- [ ] File structure and naming conventions specified

## Timeline

- **Story Creation Target:** By end of day 2025-07-31
- **Development Start:** 2025-08-01 (pending story approval)
- **Epic Completion Target:** 2025-08-02 (2 days total)

## Action Required

Bob, please:
1. Review this assignment and the Epic 3 requirements
2. Create 2-3 user stories following BMAD methodology
3. Ensure stories include comprehensive dev notes for AI implementation
4. Submit stories for Product Owner validation
5. Prepare for sprint planning session

## Success Criteria

The epic will be considered successfully assigned when:
- Stories are created in `/workspace/docs/stories/` with proper naming (3.1, 3.2, etc.)
- Story assessment report is generated
- All stories pass the scrum-master checklist
- Stories are ready for developer assignment

**Note:** This is the first endpoint implementation epic. Its success will establish patterns for Epics 4-6, so attention to detail and comprehensive testing is crucial.
