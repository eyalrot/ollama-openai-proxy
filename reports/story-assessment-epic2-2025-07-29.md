- Middleware implementation provided
- Security considerations (no sensitive data logging)

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Verified Dependencies
- ✅ Epic 1 completion (SDK type extraction and dependencies installed)
- ✅ Development environment with Python 3.12
- ✅ All required packages in requirements-dev.txt

### Story Interdependencies
1. Story 2.1 must be completed first (FastAPI foundation)
2. Stories 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 can be worked on in parallel after 2.1
3. All stories should be integrated and tested together at epic completion

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- All technologies are well-documented and stable
- Clear implementation patterns provided
- Dependencies already installed from Epic 1

### Mitigation Strategies
- Stories include specific version numbers to avoid conflicts
- Test infrastructure (2.2) enables early issue detection
- Code quality tools (2.3) prevent technical debt accumulation

## Recommendations

### For Development Team
1. **Start with Story 2.1** - Other stories depend on the FastAPI foundation
2. **Assign to bmad-developer agent** - All stories are ready for implementation
3. **Run quality tools after each story** - Maintain standards throughout development
4. **Update Makefile progressively** - Add targets as functionality is implemented

### For QA Team
1. After development completion, assign to **bmad-qa-manager agent**
2. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
3. Check test coverage meets 80% threshold
4. Validate all Makefile targets work correctly

### Sprint Planning
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 Sprint (5 days) for all four stories
- **Suggested Allocation**:
  - Day 1-2: Story 2.1 (FastAPI Setup)
  - Day 2-3: Story 2.2 (Testing) and 2.3 (Quality Tools) in parallel
  - Day 4: Story 2.4 (Logging/Errors)
  - Day 5: Integration testing and documentation

## Quality Metrics

### Story Quality Scores
- **Clarity**: 10/10 - All stories have clear goals and context
- **Technical Guidance**: 10/10 - Complete implementation details provided
- **Self-Containment**: 10/10 - Minimal external references needed
- **Testability**: 10/10 - Comprehensive testing approaches defined

### BMAD Compliance
- ✅ All required story sections present
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are measurable
- ✅ Technical implementation guidance sufficient
- ✅ Testing requirements clearly defined
- ✅ Change log properly initialized

## Conclusion

All four stories for Epic 2 have passed the BMAD METHOD quality assessment with perfect scores. The stories provide comprehensive implementation guidance while maintaining appropriate flexibility for the development team. The epic is ready to proceed to the development phase.

**Final Recommendation**: Assign all Epic 2 stories to the bmad-developer agent for implementation.
