**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Assigned By:** bmad-scrum-master  
**Assigned To:** bmad-developer  
**Story ID:** 2.3  
**Epic:** 2 - Core Application Infrastructure  

## Assignment Summary

Story 2.3 "Code Quality Tooling" has successfully passed all BMAD METHOD quality criteria and is now assigned for development implementation.

## Story Details

**Story Statement:**  
As a developer, I want automated code quality tools configured and integrated, so that I can maintain consistent code style and catch type errors early.

**Story Location:** `/workspace/docs/stories/2.3.code-quality-tooling.md`

## Pre-Development Status

- **Quality Assessment:** âœ… PASSED (10/10 clarity score)
- **Assessment Report:** `/workspace/reports/story-assessment-2.3-2025-07-29.md`
- **Dependencies:** None - standalone story
- **Blockers:** None identified

## Developer Instructions

1. **Read the full story** at `/workspace/docs/stories/2.3.code-quality-tooling.md`
2. **Follow BMAD METHOD** development guidelines in `.bmad-core/agents/dev.md`
3. **Implement all acceptance criteria** as specified in the story
4. **Run DOD checklist** upon completion using `.bmad-core/checklists/story-dod-checklist.md`
5. **Update story document** with implementation details in the Dev Agent Record section
6. **Generate completion report** in the reports folder

## Key Implementation Points

1. Configure three code quality tools:
   - Black formatter (pyproject.toml)
   - Flake8 linter (.flake8)
   - Mypy type checker (mypy.ini)

2. Create/update Makefile targets:
   - `make format`
   - `make lint`
   - `make type-check`
   - `make quality`

3. Apply formatting to existing codebase

4. Create test file: `tests/unit/test_code_quality.py`

## Expected Deliverables

1. Configuration files for all three tools
2. Updated Makefile with new targets
3. Formatted existing codebase
4. Unit tests validating the tools work correctly
5. Updated story document with implementation details
6. Completion report with DOD checklist results

## Success Criteria

- All acceptance criteria from the story are met
- DOD checklist passes completely
- Existing codebase passes all quality checks
- Documentation is updated

## Timeline

This is a medium complexity story with clear requirements. Expected completion: 1-2 hours.

## Notes

The story includes complete configuration examples, making implementation straightforward. All required tools are already installed via requirements-dev.txt.
