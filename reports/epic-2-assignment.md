# Epic 2 Assignment: Core Framework Setup

## Assignment Details

**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Assigned By**: Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Assigned To**: Bob (Scrum Master)  
**Epic**: Epic 2 - Core Framework Setup  
**Priority**: High  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 2  

## Epic Overview

Epic 2 focuses on establishing the core framework and infrastructure for the Ollama-OpenAI proxy. This epic builds upon the foundation laid in Epic 1 (SDK Type Extraction) and sets up the essential development and testing infrastructure.

## Scope of Work

### Primary Objectives
1. Set up FastAPI application structure
2. Implement core testing infrastructure
3. Establish code quality tooling
4. Create initial project skeleton

### Key Deliverables
Based on architecture documentation, Epic 2 should deliver:
- Test infrastructure (`test`, `test-unit`, `test-integration` commands)
- Code quality tools (`lint`, `format`, `type-check` commands)
- Basic FastAPI application setup
- Initial error handling framework
- Logging configuration with structlog

## Story Creation Requirements

The Scrum Master is tasked with creating detailed user stories for Epic 2 that should include:

### Story 2.1: FastAPI Application Setup
- Initialize FastAPI application structure
- Create main.py entry point
- Set up basic configuration management
- Implement health check endpoint

### Story 2.2: Testing Infrastructure
- Set up pytest configuration
- Create test directory structure
- Implement test runners for unit and integration tests
- Add pytest-asyncio and pytest-cov

### Story 2.3: Code Quality Tooling
- Configure black for code formatting
- Set up flake8 for linting
- Configure mypy for type checking
- Create Makefile targets for all tools

### Story 2.4: Logging and Error Handling
- Configure structlog for structured logging
- Create base error handling classes
- Implement error response models
- Set up logging middleware

## Story Guidelines

Each story should include:
1. Clear acceptance criteria
2. Technical implementation notes
3. Dependencies on Epic 1 outputs
4. Testing requirements
5. Definition of Done checklist

## Timeline

- **Story Creation Deadline**: End of current sprint
- **Epic Start Date**: Beginning of Sprint 2
- **Estimated Duration**: 1 Sprint (5 days)

## Dependencies

- Epic 1 completion (✓ Complete)
- Access to development environment (✓ Available)
- Python 3.12 environment (✓ Configured)

## Success Criteria

Epic 2 is considered complete when:
1. All stories are implemented and tested
2. Makefile contains all specified targets
3. Code passes all quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)
4. Test infrastructure is operational
5. Basic FastAPI app responds to health checks

## Notes from Product Owner

Based on learnings from Epic 1:
- Ensure story files are created BEFORE implementation begins
- Include clear file paths in acceptance criteria
- Consider mock data requirements for offline development
- Reference coding standards from architecture documentation

## Next Steps

1. Scrum Master to acknowledge this assignment
2. Create individual story files in `/workspace/docs/stories/`
3. Review stories with Product Owner before Sprint 2
4. Assign stories to development team
