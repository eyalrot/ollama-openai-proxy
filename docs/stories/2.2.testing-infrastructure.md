# Story 2.2: Testing Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a comprehensive testing infrastructure set up,
**so that** I can write and run unit and integration tests with proper coverage reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pytest configured with appropriate plugins for async testing and coverage
2. Test directory structure created following project standards
3. Test configuration file (pytest.ini) properly configured
4. Conftest.py created with shared fixtures for testing
5. Makefile targets for test execution work correctly (`test`, `test-unit`, `test-integration`)
6. Coverage reporting configured with minimum 80% threshold
7. Test markers configured for unit and integration test separation
8. Example tests created to verify infrastructure works

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Test file location:** `tests/unit/test_testing_setup.py`

**Test standards:**
- Verify pytest can discover and run tests
- Verify coverage reporting works
- Verify markers filter tests correctly
- Test that fixtures are available and work

**Testing frameworks:**
- pytest 7.4.4
- pytest-asyncio 0.23.3
- pytest-cov 4.1.0

**Specific testing requirements:**
- Meta-test to verify test infrastructure works
- Verify async tests run correctly
- Verify coverage threshold enforcement
- Test that both unit and integration test markers work

### Relevant Source Tree
```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py               # Pytest configuration
├── integration/              # Integration tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_example_integration.py
└── unit/                     # Unit tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_example.py
```

### Technical Notes
- All test dependencies are already in requirements-dev.txt from Epic 1
- Use `pytest.mark.unit` and `pytest.mark.integration` for test separation
- Coverage should exclude test files themselves and `__init__.py` files
- Use `pytest-asyncio` fixture `async_test` or mark tests with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
- Test client fixture should override configuration to use test values
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) in all tests

### Pytest.ini Configuration
The pytest.ini file should include:
```ini
[tool:pytest]
testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*
asyncio_mode = auto
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests
addopts = 
    --strict-markers
    -v
```

### Coverage Configuration
Coverage should be configured to:
- Exclude test files from coverage
- Exclude `__init__.py` files
- Generate both terminal and HTML reports
- Fail if coverage is below 80%

### Example Fixture Patterns
```python
# In conftest.py
@pytest.fixture
def test_app():
    """Create test FastAPI application"""
    
@pytest.fixture
async def test_client(test_app):
    """Create async test client"""
    
@pytest.fixture
def override_settings():
    """Override configuration for tests"""
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of testing infrastructure with comprehensive fixtures and thoughtful solutions to compatibility issues. The developer went above and beyond by creating meta-tests to verify the infrastructure itself works correctly. The httpx 0.28.1 compatibility issue was elegantly resolved using ASGITransport instead of downgrading dependencies.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - the implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Python conventions and project standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Test organization matches architecture documentation  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Aligns perfectly with test-strategy-and-standards.md
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

All items are suggestions for future enhancements, not blockers:

- [ ] Consider adding a `make test-coverage` target specifically for coverage reports
- [ ] Document the httpx compatibility solution in a technical notes file
- [ ] Consider adding performance benchmarks for critical paths in future stories

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Test infrastructure properly isolates test data and uses appropriate mocking strategies.

### Performance Considerations

Test execution is efficient with appropriate use of fixtures. Meta-tests that spawn subprocesses are necessarily slower but still performant.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

All acceptance criteria met with 87.80% code coverage (exceeding the 80% requirement). The testing infrastructure is robust and ready for use.
