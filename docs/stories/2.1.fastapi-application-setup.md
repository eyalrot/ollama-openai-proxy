# Story 2.1: FastAPI Application Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the core FastAPI application structure set up,
**so that** I can build API endpoints and have a foundation for the proxy service

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FastAPI application initialized with proper project structure in `app/` directory
2. Main entry point created at `app/main.py` with FastAPI app instance
3. Configuration management implemented in `app/config.py` using environment variables
4. Health check endpoint `/health` returns proper status with version information
5. Application runs successfully on port 11434 using uvicorn
6. Basic CORS configuration implemented for development
7. Proper application metadata set (title, description, version)
8. Makefile targets created for running the application (`run`, `run-dev`)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create FastAPI application structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `app/__init__.py` module
  - [x] Create `app/main.py` with FastAPI app instance
  - [x] Set application metadata (title="Ollama OpenAI Proxy", version="0.1.0")
  
- [x] Implement configuration management (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create `app/config.py` module
  - [x] Define Settings class using Pydantic BaseSettings
  - [x] Include configuration for: app_name, version, port, host, log_level, environment
  - [x] Use environment variables with sensible defaults
  
- [x] Create health check endpoint (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create `app/handlers/__init__.py` module
  - [x] Create `app/handlers/health.py` module
  - [x] Implement GET `/health` endpoint returning JSON with status and version
  - [x] Include timestamp and environment in health response
  
- [x] Configure CORS middleware (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add CORSMiddleware to FastAPI app
  - [x] Configure for development (allow all origins initially)
  - [x] Document that this needs to be restricted for production
  
- [x] Verify application runs correctly (AC: 5)
  - [x] Test manual startup with `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 11434`
  - [x] Verify health endpoint responds at http://localhost:11434/health
  
- [x] Update Makefile with run targets (AC: 8)
  - [x] Add `run` target for production mode
  - [x] Add `run-dev` target with --reload flag
  - [x] Ensure targets use correct host and port configuration

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Test file location:** `tests/unit/test_main.py`, `tests/unit/test_config.py`, `tests/integration/test_health_integration.py`

**Test standards:** 
- Use pytest with pytest-asyncio for async endpoint testing
- Mock environment variables for config testing
- Test health endpoint returns 200 status code
- Verify all required fields in health response
- Use TestClient from FastAPI for integration tests

**Testing frameworks:**
- pytest 7.4.4
- pytest-asyncio 0.23.3
- FastAPI TestClient for endpoint testing

**Specific testing requirements:**
- Unit test for configuration loading with different environment variables
- Unit test for health endpoint response format
- Integration test verifying full application startup
- Test CORS headers are properly set

├── __init__.py
├── main.py                    # FastAPI app entry point

└── handlers/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── health.py             # /health endpoint
```

### Technical Notes
- FastAPI version: 0.109.0
- Uvicorn version: 0.27.0
- Python version: 3.12
- Use Pydantic v2 features for configuration (Pydantic 2.5.3)
- All code must follow black formatting and pass flake8/mypy checks
- Use async def for all endpoint handlers
- Configuration should use Pydantic BaseSettings for automatic env var loading
- Default port must be 11434 (Ollama's default port)

### Configuration Variables
Required environment variables to support:
- `APP_NAME` (default: "Ollama OpenAI Proxy")
- `APP_VERSION` (default: "0.1.0")
- `APP_ENV` (default: "development")
- `LOG_LEVEL` (default: "INFO")
- `HOST` (default: "0.0.0.0")
- `PORT` (default: "11434")
