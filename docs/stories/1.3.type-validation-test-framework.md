# Story 1.3: Type Validation & Test Framework Setup

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** automated validation that our extracted Ollama types match collected OpenAI responses and a test framework ready for TDD,
**so that** we can ensure type compatibility and have infrastructure for writing tests before implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Python script exists at `scripts/validate_type_compatibility.py` that validates extracted types against collected responses
2. The validation script checks that all Ollama model fields can be populated from OpenAI responses
3. A comprehensive test framework is established in the `tests/` directory structure
4. The test framework includes pytest configuration with proper fixture management
5. A sample integration test demonstrates using Ollama SDK to call our (future) FastAPI server
6. The Makefile includes targets for type validation and running tests
7. All validation results are saved to `references/validation-report.json` with clear pass/fail status
8. The test framework supports both unit and integration testing with clear separation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create type validation script (AC: 1, 2, 7)
  - [x] Load extracted Ollama types from `references/ollama-types/`
  - [x] Load collected OpenAI responses from `references/openai-examples/`

  - [x] Create `pytest.ini` with test discovery and reporting settings
  - [x] Set up fixtures for loading test data from references/
  - [x] Configure test markers for unit vs integration tests
  - [x] Add coverage reporting configuration
- [x] Create sample integration test (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create `tests/integration/test_framework_setup.py`
  - [x] Write test that demonstrates Ollama SDK client usage
  - [x] Mock the FastAPI server response for now
  - [x] Document the TDD pattern for future stories
- [x] Update Makefile (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add `validate-types` target to run validation script
  - [x] Add `test` target to run all tests
  - [x] Add `test-unit` target for unit tests only
  - [x] Add `test-integration` target for integration tests only
  - [x] Add `coverage` target for test coverage report

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Structure

From the architecture document, the test structure should be:

```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py                   # Pytest fixtures and configuration
├── integration/                  # Ollama SDK tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_tags_integration.py
│   ├── test_generate_integration.py
│   ├── test_chat_integration.py
│   └── test_embeddings_integration.py
└── unit/                         # Component tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_request_translator.py
    ├── test_response_translator.py
    ├── test_parameter_mapping.py
    ├── test_error_handling.py
    └── test_streaming_handler.py
```

### Key Implementation Details

1. The validation script should verify that every field in Ollama's Pydantic models can be populated from the OpenAI response data
2. Use the `ollama-python` SDK (already in requirements-dev.txt) for integration tests
3. Integration tests will use the actual Ollama SDK to make requests to our proxy (once built)
4. For this story, create just the framework setup test - actual endpoint tests come in later epics
5. The validation report should clearly identify any fields that cannot be mapped

### Dependencies from Previous Stories

- Story 1.1 created `scripts/extract_ollama_types.py` and extracted types to `references/ollama-types/`
- Story 1.2 created `scripts/collect_openai_responses.py` and collected responses to `references/openai-examples/`
- Both scripts are working and data is available for validation

### Testing Standards

From the architecture document:

- Test file location: `tests/unit/` for unit tests, `tests/integration/` for integration tests
- Test file naming: `test_*.py` convention
- Testing framework: pytest with fixtures in conftest.py
- Coverage requirement: 80% minimum (to be enforced in Epic 9)
- Integration tests use actual Ollama SDK as client
- Markers: @pytest.mark.unit and @pytest.mark.integration for test categorization
