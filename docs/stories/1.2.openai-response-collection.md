# Story 1.2: OpenAI Response Collection

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to collect real OpenAI API responses,
**so that** we have accurate examples for translating between OpenAI and Ollama formats

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Python script exists at `scripts/collect_openai_responses.py` that collects responses from OpenAI API
2. Collected responses are saved to `references/openai-examples/` directory with proper organization
3. Script collects responses for all supported endpoints: models list, chat completions, and text completions
4. Each response is saved with metadata including request parameters and timestamp
5. Makefile target `collect-responses` runs the collection script
6. Script requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and provides clear error if missing
7. Collection process includes multiple examples with different parameters for comprehensive coverage

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create the collection script structure (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Create `scripts/collect_openai_responses.py` file
  - [x] Add script header with proper shebang and documentation
  - [x] Set up logging configuration using structlog
  - [x] Create main function with argument parsing
  - [x] Add environment variable check for OPENAI_API_KEY with clear error message
- [x] Task 2: Implement OpenAI client setup (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Install openai package in requirements-dev.txt
  - [x] Initialize OpenAI client with API key from environment
  - [x] Add error handling for API authentication issues
  - [x] Add rate limiting considerations
- [x] Task 3: Implement models endpoint collection (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Call OpenAI models.list() endpoint
  - [x] Save response to `references/openai-examples/models.json`
  - [x] Include metadata with timestamp and request info
  - [x] Handle pagination if necessary
- [x] Task 4: Implement chat completions collection (AC: 2, 3, 4, 7)
  - [x] Create `references/openai-examples/chat/` directory
  - [x] Collect responses with different model parameters (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
  - [x] Vary parameters: temperature, max_tokens, system prompts, multi-turn conversations
  - [x] Save each example as `example_<descriptor>.json` with metadata
  - [x] Include both streaming and non-streaming responses
- [x] Task 5: Implement text completions collection (AC: 2, 3, 4, 7)
  - [x] Create `references/openai-examples/completions/` directory
  - [x] Collect responses from legacy completions endpoint if still available
  - [x] If deprecated, document this and focus on chat completions
  - [x] Vary parameters: prompt styles, temperature, max_tokens
  - [x] Save each example as `example_<descriptor>.json` with metadata
- [x] Task 6: Add Makefile integration (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add `collect-responses` target to existing Makefile
  - [x] Include proper help documentation
  - [x] Add check for OPENAI_API_KEY before running
- [x] Task 7: Add response validation and organization (AC: 2, 4, 7)
  - [x] Validate JSON structure of collected responses
  - [x] Add index file listing all collected examples
  - [x] Ensure consistent naming convention
  - [x] Add summary statistics (models used, parameter ranges, etc.)
- [x] Task 8: Documentation and cost management (AC: 6, 7)
  - [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions
  - [x] Document expected API costs for collection
  - [x] Add --dry-run option to preview what would be collected
  - [x] Create inline documentation about response formats

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Collection script location: `scripts/collect_openai_responses.py`
- Output location: `references/openai-examples/` with subdirectories:
  - `models.json` - Models list response
  - `chat/example_*.json` - Chat completion examples
  - `completions/example_*.json` - Text completion examples (if available)

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Python 3.12 (exact version required)
- openai (latest version compatible with Python 3.12)
- structlog 24.1.0 for logging
- Environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY required

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use snake_case for files and functions
- All functions must have complete type annotations
- Use Google style docstrings
- No print statements - use structlog for all logging
- Import order: standard library, third-party, local (separated by blank lines)

### Key Technical Details
- OpenAI API requires authentication via API key
- Responses should include both successful and error examples
- Each example should be self-contained with request and response
- Consider API rate limits and costs
- This is a development-only tool (not deployed to production)

### Example Collection Strategy
Based on the PRD requirements, collect examples for:
1. **Models List**: Single response showing available models
2. **Chat Completions**: 
   - Simple single-turn conversation
   - Multi-turn conversation with system prompt
   - Streaming response example
   - Different temperature settings (0, 0.5, 1.0)
   - Different models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
3. **Text Completions** (if available):
   - Simple prompt completion
   - Different prompt styles
   - Various max_tokens settings

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Unit tests not required for this collection script
- Manual testing required to verify collected responses
- Validate JSON structure of all collected files
- Ensure no sensitive data in collected examples

### Debug Log References
- Successfully created collect_openai_responses.py script with all required functionality
- Implemented async OpenAI client with proper error handling and rate limiting
- Added comprehensive collection for models, chat completions, and documented completions deprecation
- Integrated JSON validation and index file generation
- Added cost estimates and dry-run mode for safe testing

### Completion Notes List
- OpenAI API key is loaded from .env file using python-dotenv
- Text completions endpoint is deprecated - created documentation file instead
- Implemented streaming response collection with proper chunk accumulation
- GPT-4 example included but may fail if API key doesn't have access
- Cost estimates provided: total collection < $0.50
- Index file automatically generated after collection with summary statistics

### File List

- Modified: /workspace/requirements-dev.txt (added openai>=1.12.0)
- Modified: /workspace/Makefile (enhanced collect-responses target with API key check)
- Note: python-dotenv installed for .env file support
