# Checklist Results Report

## Architecture Validation Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Validated By:** Winston (Architect)  
**Updates Made:**
1. Removed REST API Spec section - Will be discovered during SDK extraction phase
2. Validated directory structure - Clear separation of concerns confirmed
3. Added Makefile requirements - Progressive enhancement approach defined
4. Updated httpx version rationale based on compatibility findings
5. Added Known Issues section documenting testing limitations

**Key Architecture Decisions Validated:**
- TDD approach with SDK extraction first
- Monolithic service with clear internal separation
- Stateless design for scalability
- Progressive Makefile development for user experience
- DevContainer-based development environment
- All dependencies pinned to specific versions for stability

**New Learnings Incorporated:**
- httpx must remain at version 0.26.0 due to TestClient compatibility
- BaseHTTPMiddleware has known testing limitations that don't affect production
- Dependency version pinning is critical to avoid breaking changes

**Status:** Architecture document updated with implementation learnings and remains aligned with PRD.
